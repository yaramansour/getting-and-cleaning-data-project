## About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform the following steps: 
1. Download the dataset and unzip the files.  
2. assign column names to the training and the testing sets.  
3. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.     
4. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement     
5. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
6. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names   
7. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
8. Writing second tidy data set in txt file

## About variables:   
* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `train` and `test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
