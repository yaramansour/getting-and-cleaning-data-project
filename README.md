# getting-and-cleaning-data-project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
reading all files
assign column names
merging all datasets
Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
writing the second dataset to secTidySet.txt.
